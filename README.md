End-to-End Machine Learning Classification Project

It is a binary classification task that has to aims to classify defaulted loans with the Tree-Based
approaches.

Many feature engineering techniques were applied like Mean Encoding, Weight-of-Evidence(WOE)
Encoding, and Winsorization. Recursive Elimination was used for feature selection. The features were
selected by criteria such as Tree-Importance and Mutual Information. XGBoost algorithm was used
with early stopping. Hyperparameters of the algorithm were tuned with Multistage GridSearch.

The Recall metric was maximized under the condition that %80 the Precision score, and it achieved
%83.
